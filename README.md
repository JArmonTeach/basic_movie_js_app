# Movie Search Application

## Project Description 
This ReactJS program acts as basic movie search application.

React 18.2.0 was used so as to learn its basic syntax and semantics through the operations of a movie search application. 

A challenge that came about was how to fetch the data from the movie API when the initial page loads. The useEffect hook provided a solution from the react library which fetched all the movies after the firs trender and after every update search in the app.

## Installation
Before creating a pull request for this repository, your machine will need to have:

    1. React (version 18.2.0 or higher)
    
Dependencies for this project can be found in the package.json file

    or the SBOM file can be exported in Github in the repository settings > insights > dependecy graph

## Usage
    1. Once application is ran, the landing page will appear. (To note: the initial movies that will appear will be connected to Indiana Jones due to personal preference. This could be changed in the App.js file by changing the string inside the searchMovies() method to your own preference.)
    2. You may type in the search for other movies.
    3. Click the search icon and the new set of movies related to your searched words will appear.
